Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- It is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Requirements Gathering
This comes before moving forward with any project. One needs to understand the objectives and project scope of the client.
- Solution design and Project Scoping
Once the requirements are understood and well documented, the technical team will begin working on a solution design which provides the engineering blueprint for a software solution.
- Pre-Development Planning
It is a short phase where the technical team collaborate to address the foundational technical design  decisions and project execution plans. They discuss things like languages, tools or frameworks to be used, hosting, scalability requirements, etc

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Plan - Includes tasks like cost benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation and allocation
2. Design - Software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software
3. Implement - The development team codes the product.
4. Test - The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs
5. Deploy - This is the phase where the developed software is made available for the users
6. Maintain - The team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues and manages the developed software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall  methodology follows a linear and sequential approach where each phase must first be completed before the next one begins. The typical phases includes Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, deployment and Maintenance
- Waterfall would be appropriate for projects in highly regulated industries like healthcare or aerospace where requirements are strict and changes are costly.
2. Agile methodology emphasizes flexibility and iterative progress. Projects are divided into small, manageable units called sprints or iterations with regular reassessment and adaptation of goals and processes.
- Agile would be appropriate in projects for startups or those involving new and innovative products where requirements are uncertain and likely to evolve.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
-  Write, debug, and maintain code for software applications. This includes implementing features, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance
-  Contribute to designing the software architecture and system components, ensuring that the code aligns with overall system design.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
